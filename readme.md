Mars Rover
===================

Hey! I'm your first Markdown document in **StackEdit**[^stackedit]. Don't delete me, I'm very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the **Utils** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

----------
How To
-------------
To execute Mars Rover use the *execListOfCommands* function with a list of commands (see example):

```
execListOfCommands ("rflfffrfflfffflf")
```

There are two Rover moving in a 10x10 grid and the turn changes when one of them move forward or backward.

You can use this function several times. If you do that, the travel log register all the movements.
